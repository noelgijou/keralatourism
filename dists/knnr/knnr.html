<p class="fofa slick">
    &emsp; Considered as one of the most historic sites in Kannur, the St. Angelo Fort was constructed by the first Portuguese viceroy of India. The fort is triangular in shape appears as a massive yet magnificent structure standing at the helm of the ruthless sea. 

    The laterite walls made of stone lend it an even more imposing air and it is a must-visit destination for architecture students. The sea wall segregating the fort from the sea provides breathtaking views of the Mopilla Bay. Visit the fort for taking a relaxing walk in the complex and enjoy stunning views of the Arabian Sea.

<p class="fofa slick">
    &emsp; Perched at a height of 286 meters, the Ezhimala hill is one of the most visually appealing Kannur tourist places. The hill is a part of an isolated cluster of hills and the vantage point offers bedazzling views of the sheer naked natural splendour around – hills covered in a blanket of green, cotton white clouds covering the clear blue skies, and the beautiful valley underneath. 

    The place also has cultural and historical significance – the place was a battlefield during the Chola-Chera wars. Buddhists consider the place sacred because it is believed that Lord Buddha visited Ezhimala.

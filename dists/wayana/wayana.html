    <h1>Wayanad</h1>
<p class="fofa lead slick"> 
    &emsp; Wayanad is an Indian district in the north-east of Kerala state with administrative headquarters at the municipality of Kalpetta. 
    It is set high on the Western Ghats with altitudes ranging from 700 to 2100 meters.
     The district was formed on 1 November 1980 as the 12th district in Kerala by carving out areas from Kozhikode and Kannur districts.
      About 885.92 sq.km of area of the district is under forest.
       Wayanad has three municipal towns—Kalpetta, Mananthavady and Sulthan Bathery. 
       There are many indigenous tribals in this area.

<p class="fofa slick">
    &emsp; Wayanad is home to India’s largest earthen dam, the Banasura Sagar.
     The dam, which was constructed in 1979, is built across the Karamanathodu tributary of the Kabani River.
      It is named after the Asura king Banasura, son of Mahabali, who is said to have observed a severe penance in the surrounding hills. 
      The dam is made entirely of massive stacks of rocks and stones, and has become a popular tourist spot, known for its spectacular views and boating trips.

    <h3> Edakkal Caves </h3>

<p class="fofa slick">
    &emsp;Located at about 1200 ft above the sea level, the Edakkal Caves are among the oldest human settlements ever discovered. Inside the caves are pictorial drawings and engravings that indicate the presence of ancient human settlements in the region.

    Despite their name, the Edakkal Caves are not actually caves. They are part of a pre historic rock shelter, formed naturally when one huge boulder got wedged between two bigger ones. The name Edakkal itself means “a stone in between”.
